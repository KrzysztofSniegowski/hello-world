# hello-world
My first repository

Hallo Everyone!

It's my first time on GitHub. I would like to learn how to create responsive web sites and learn to code in JavaScript. This will be something totaly new for me. I'm realy excited to have the opportunity to learn web development as it is my goal to work as developer.
